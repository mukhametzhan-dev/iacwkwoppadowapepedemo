# Solana Integration Setup & Run Instructions

## Overview
This project has been extended with Solana blockchain integration, providing a minimal, safe, working MVP for connecting to Solana's **devnet** environment. The integration includes wallet connection, balance display, and proper error handling.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Solana-compatible browser wallet (Phantom recommended)
- Modern browser with web3 support

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Test Solana Integration
1. Scroll down to the "Solana Integration Demo" section
2. Click "Connect Wallet" button
3. Select your preferred wallet (Phantom recommended)
4. Approve the connection in your wallet
5. View your devnet address and SOL balance

## Available Scripts

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Testing
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### Linting
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Wallet Integration
- **Provider Setup**: Solana wallet adapter configured for devnet
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Phantom wallet adapter with extensible architecture
- **Auto-Connect**: Disabled for security (users must manually connect)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for connection failures

### ✅ UI Components
- **WalletInfo Component**: Displays connection status, address, and balance
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during connection and balance fetching
- **Styled Interface**: Integrates with existing Shadcn/UI design system

### ✅ Security Features
- **Devnet Only**: Hardcoded to use Solana devnet (never mainnet)
- **No Private Keys**: All signing handled by browser wallet
- **Environment Config**: RPC URL configurable via environment variables
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative settings throughout

### ✅ Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Component testing with React Testing Library
- **Mocked Dependencies**: Web3 interactions mocked for reliable testing
- **Coverage**: Test coverage tracking configured
- **CI Ready**: Tests run in headless environment

└── test/
    └── setup.ts               # Test configuration and mocks
```

### Key Dependencies
- `@solana/web3.js` - Core Solana functionality
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-*` - Wallet connection libraries
- `@solana/spl-token` - Token interaction capabilities
- `axios` - HTTP client for RPC calls
- Testing libraries for comprehensive test coverage

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

### Network Configuration
- **Default Network**: Solana Devnet
- **RPC Endpoint**: `https://api.devnet.solana.com`
- **Fallback**: Hardcoded devnet URL if environment variable missing

## Testing Guide

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure
- **Component Tests**: Verify UI rendering and user interactions
- **Provider Tests**: Ensure wallet context works correctly
- **Mocked Web3**: All blockchain interactions are mocked for reliability
- **Error Scenarios**: Tests cover connection failures and edge cases

## Wallet Compatibility

### Supported Wallets
- **Phantom** ✅ (Primary support)
- **Solflare** ⚡ (Can be added)
- **Backpack** ⚡ (Can be added)

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browsers with web3 support
- Wallet extensions installed and configured
- JavaScript enabled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Wallet Not Detected
- Ensure Phantom or compatible wallet is installed
- Refresh the page after installing wallet extension
- Check browser console for detailed errors

#### Connection Failures
- Verify wallet is set to Devnet (not Mainnet)
- Clear browser cache and restart
- Check network connectivity

#### Balance Not Loading
- Confirm wallet has devnet SOL (use Solana faucet if needed)
- Wait a few seconds for RPC response
- Check browser console for RPC errors

### Development Issues

#### Build Errors
- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to resolve dependency conflicts
- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall if needed
- Check TypeScript compilation errors

#### Test Failures
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Run tests in clean environment
- Check for mock configuration issues

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- **Token Display**: Show SPL token balances
- **Transaction History**: Display recent transactions
- **Send/Receive**: Basic transaction functionality
- **NFT Integration**: Display owned NFTs
- **Multi-Network**: Support for mainnet (with warnings)

### Architecture Improvements
- **State Management**: Consider Zustand/Redux for complex state
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for better UX
- **Performance**: Code splitting for wallet adapters
- **Offline Support**: Cache balance and connection state

## Security Notes

### Important Reminders
- **Never commit private keys** to version control
- **Always use devnet** for development and testing
- **Validate user inputs** before sending transactions
- **Handle errors gracefully** to prevent crashes
- **Keep dependencies updated** for security patches

### Best Practices Followed
- Environment-based configuration
- No hardcoded sensitive data
- Proper error handling throughout
- Minimal permission requests
- User consent for all actions

## Quick Validation

To verify the integration is working:

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to wallet section**: Scroll to "Solana Integration Demo"
3. **Connect wallet**: Click the connect button
4. **Verify connection**: Should show address and balance
5. **Test disconnect**: Disconnect from wallet extension

The integration is successful if you can connect your wallet and see your devnet balance displayed in the UI.
